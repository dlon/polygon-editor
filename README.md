# Polygon editor
This is a slightly improved fork of libgdx-polygoneditor for editing .psh files.

.psh files can be used with the asset manager of [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com). Cf. [PolygonRegionLoader](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/PolygonRegionLoader.html).
